This is the Go App Engine for Managed VMs project.

Directory structure
-------------------
The top level of this repository is the `appengine` package. It contains the
basic types (e.g. appengine.Context) that are used across APIs. Specific API
packages are in subdirectories (e.g. `datastore`).

There is an `internal` subdirectory that contains service protocol buffers,
plus packages required for connectivity to make API calls. App Engine apps
should not directly import any package under `internal`.

Protos
------
Protocol buffers live under subdirectories of `internal`.
To rebuild them you will need protoc and goprotobuf installed;
see https://code.google.com/p/goprotobuf/ for instructions.
